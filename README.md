Within this repository, you will find a comprehensive set of scripts designed for the in-depth analysis of brain connectivity, specifically employing Granger causality techniques. These analyses are specifically tailored for examining brain connectivity patterns during the performance of the Endotracheal Intubation (ETI) task, a critical medical procedure.

Notably, our study involved two distinct groups of trainees. One group underwent the ETI training under typical conditions, while the other group was intentionally subjected to additional stressors during the training process. The primary objective was to meticulously observe and assess the potential impact of this induced stress on brain activation and connectivity patterns.
